## Descriptions: 
All of the helper tools require python 3 to run on your computer, they are not mods but rather scripts that automate a lot of repetitive tasks that can come with Jet modding in its current form.

**LeaksCostMoney**
- This mod makes the game solely reliant on how much cash you have. Simply put, bloons leaked costs you cash instead of lives, and if you get to 0 cash then it's game over! I highly recommend reading through the code as you can change the weight of each bloon and make the game easier or more difficult for yourself. Inspiration from Tewtiy's video, original Mod idea from DisabledMallis.

**ScalingDartMonkey**
- Simple .py script that takes the dart monkey and gives it a small boost. Regardless of the upgrade path you choose, this mod edits the fire rate, range, and pierce based on the highest upgrade path purchased. Place this mod in the BloonsTD6\ScriptMods\Python folder and do not change the name of the file.

**EditBehaviors**
 - ***Helper Tool*** - This tool is used to mass modify the behaviors of the towers for the Jet Mods. The best way to utilize this tool is to first choose all tower behaviors that you are wishing to edit inside of Jet\Towers\Behaviors, and copy the selected folders to JetCompiled\Towers\Behaviors. After you have done this, modify the Python code to mass edit whatever Tower Behaviors you wish to edit. Included is an example of modifying the Boomerang Monkeys. The easiest way to figure out what you can edit is by simply opening up the JSON files and going from there.

 **random_run**
- ***Helper Tool*** - This tool goes through all possible towers and randomly chooses tower paths to be locked off for that play for a playthrough. Simply place this mod in your root BTD 6 folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\BloonsTD6) and run it one time. This tool automatically moves all files associated with Jet Modding so that you simply have to run the script a single time.
