# BTD6-Modding
Random collection of different mods that I have created so far
- To use the dll mods, you need to have [melonloader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/README) installed 
- To use the Scripting mods you need to have [Kosmic's Script Api](https://github.com/KosmicShovel/BTD6-Mods/tree/master/BTD6%20Script%20Api)
